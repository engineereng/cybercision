dialogue Gooooood morning once again Monsoon Lows! Today is an especially strange-

speaker N
dialogue You silently turn off your radio alarm, then get out of bed immediately.

dialogue You get dressed into your standard outfit as Hal continues to sleep soundly at the foot of your bed.

dialogue You walk downstairs without so much as a lick of food, and immediately open your shop for the day.

dialogue You don't feel hungry enough to eat. You only want to wait for Mr. Washi to show up.

dialogue You wait in near silence for what feels like hours. Lightning cracks outside and rain pummels your roof. It's incredibly stormy out there.

dialogue Regardless of who this guy is, the fact that he knows about your lack of license is greatly troubling, lonely old man or not.

dialogue Maybe it's the business of the last few days getting to you, but it feels like your thoughts are racing more than normal.

dialogue Your body grows tense as you await the old janitor to enter through your door.

dialogue Something creaks. You jump as lightning strikes outside your window. That seemed dangerously close.

dialogue You look outside at what the lightning had arced to. You gasp.

dialogue Mr. Washi lies flat against the street. His chest smokes with black smog.

dialogue You run outside and heft him over your shoulder. He feels very light for a man as tall as he is.

dialogue You bring him inside and throw him down on your rarely used operating table.

dialogue You bring your ear to his chest while holding his wrist. No pulse.

dialogue You curse, then cut open his shirt with surgical shears.

dialogue A metal device juts out from the left side of his chest. It smokes violently into the room.

dialogue You pull out a small fire extinguisher and use it to stop the smoke.

dialogue You plug in a heart monitoring device alongside an IED. The piercing screech of the flatline noise evokes a flash of painful memories in your head.

dialogue You shake it off, breathe in, then shock his chest.

dialogue Again. Again. Again.

dialogue His heart begins to beat faintly. If you keep up with CPR, you think you'll be able to save him.

dialogue His heart and cybernetics fall in sync. The monitor shows it beating slow and steady. 

dialogue You exhale deeply. Your head is spinning, and you feel like you've been holding your breath this whole time.

dialogue Flashes of the flatlining monitor resound through your head.

dialogue You sit down as your head pounds. 

dialogue Minutes pass as you watch Mr. Washi slowly come back to consciousness.

dialogue His heartbeat picks up a little and he begins to stir.

dialogue Hello?

speaker MC
dialogue Hi.

speaker W
dialogue Did you..?

speaker N
dialogue Mr Washi looks at his cybernetic chest augmentation, then back up at you. You nod.

speaker W
dialogue Thank you.

speaker MC
dialogue An ambulance will be here soon. I may have restarted your heart but you're not out of the fire just yet.

who:
speaker W
dialogue I am a member of the medical board for Galnatronics.

speaker MC
dialogue Are you now?

speaker W
dialogue Yes. I was supposed to evaluate your performance at your place of work.

speaker MC
dialogue Why?

speaker W
dialogue They were thinking of reinstating you. Something about bygones be bygones.

speaker MC
dialogue I see.

why:

dialogue I am supposed to be evaluating you. The incident that got your medical license revoked has been under review.

dialogue Why?

speaker W
dialogue They were thinking about reinstating you.

dialogue I do not know, really.

janitor:

dialogue Obviously not. I am a board member who is supposed to evaluate you.

speaker MC
dialogue You didn't really try to hide how suspicious you are.

speaker W
dialogue Stealth is not my priority here. I just have to see if you are worthy of reinstating.

speaker MC
dialogue You could've been nicer.

dialogue So what happens now?

speaker W
dialogue Well, you showed promise when I saw your prosthetic feline leg yesterday.

speaker N
dialogue He tilts his head up off the table to look at you.

speaker W
dialogue But now that you've saved my life, I supposed I owe you one. Plus, that was a good show of progress.

dialogue So you know about-

speaker W
dialogue Yes.

speaker MC
dialogue If only I had the skills I have now back when that happened.

speaker W
dialogue Do not linger in the past, kiddo.

speaker N
dialogue He leans up off the table to a sitting position.

speaker W
dialogue If you are going to survive out here, you have to look to the future.

dialogue Look how far you've come already! You have a fresh new start away from everything. God. I wish I had the same drive to stand back up as you.

speaker MC
dialogue Thank you. Genuinely.

speaker N
dialogue A hover ambulance floats down outside, landing next to that ever present front door.

dialogue Medical staff rush in, and you prepare Mr. Washi to slide onto a stretcher.

dialogue The medics thank you for your work, and begin to wheel him out the door.

dialogue Mr. Washi hold up his hand for them to stop, then beckons you closer.

speaker W
dialogue We need more people like you, kiddo. It's not often we get people with empathy these days.

dialogue It's all numbers and maths. Taking the human part out of the practice of medicine.

dialogue Consider it. I can reinstate you.

speaker MC
dialogue I will. Thank you.

speaker N
dialogue The medics roll him out the door and into the hover ambulance.

dialogue It takes off into the stormy afternoon sky, leaving you in silence.

dialogue You take the time to ponder your choices. The people you've met around Monsoon Lows, the calmness of your nights at home, you finding and saving Hal on a day like today.

dialogue But you also miss the cushyness of your old apartment, the sound of quiet rain and gentle snow. The coworkers you loved and loved to hate.

dialogue You deliberate for a while, but eventually you have made a decision.

choice Return to your old life.
choice Keep starting anew.
makechoice Your choice.

dialogue The choice is made.

dialogue Your choice.

dialogue From here your life will go on. Filled with potential, friends, and allies. In this dark and stormy city, maybe you can make a difference.

dialogue However it goes from here is yet to be known, but with Hal by your side, you hope... no. You know, that everything will be just fine.

dialogue The End.
