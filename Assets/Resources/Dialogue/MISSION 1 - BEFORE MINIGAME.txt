dialogue Clouds today are dark and mixed with industrial smog, so watch out for acid downpour! Dig out your steel umbrellas and stay safe out ther-

speaker MC
dialogue Alright, enough of that.

speaker N
dialogue Your joints ache as you slam your hand against the old-tech radio on your desk. You stand up from the rock hard bed and stretch wide like a cat, grunting aloud.

speaker MC
dialogue Looks like another day of nothing ahead of us, huh.

speaker N
dialogue You reach down and lightly pet your cat.

speaker MC
dialogue Right buddy?

speaker N
dialogue Your cat meows politely, then leaps off the bed and trots towards an empty food bowl.

speaker MC
dialogue *Sigh* Yeah. Yeah. Here you go.

speaker N
dialogue You fill up half of your cat's bowl, finishing the rest of the food bag.

speaker MC 
dialogue That's all for now, bud.

speaker N

dialogue You flick on the lights, turn on the "open" sign, and sanitize your workstation.

speaker MC 
dialogue Nice. Clean.

speaker N
dialogue You putter around, looking for anything to clean, then settle down in an office chair at the front desk. You power on your computer and check your E-Mail.

speaker N
dialogue The tattooed woman sits down in a chair on the opposite side of your desk. She makes it look small.

speaker MC
dialogue What's the problem?

speaker B?
dialogue My hand's on the fritz. Can't really do anything with a couple-a busted-up digits, much less work.

speaker MC
dialogue I see. What's your name?

speaker B
dialogue Bobbi. Bobbi Aguja.

speaker MC
dialogue Welcome to the clinic, Bobbi, I'm <player>. A pleasure to meet you. Hopefully we can get your hand fixed up relatively quickly, but I'm going to ask you a few questions first, is that alright?

dialogue Shoot away!

speaker MC
dialogue First off... what's your profession?

speaker B
dialogue I'm part of the artsy side of the body mod industry... piercings and tattoos mostly.

speaker MC
dialogue Ah. That is unfortunate given your problem. Is your hand a replacement or an aesthetic choice?

speaker B
dialogue Replacement.

speaker N

choice Ask about her hand.

dialogue Please continue.

speaker B
dialogue I was workin' up in the Downtown sector at the time. Uh. Corpo shenanigans, stuff like that.
