dialogue Clouds today are dark and mixed with industrial smog, so watch out for acid downpour! Dig out your steel umbrellas and stay safe out ther-

speaker MC
dialogue Alright, enough of that.

speaker N
dialogue Your joints ache as you slam your hand against the old-tech radio on your desk. You stand up from the rock hard bed and stretch wide like a cat, grunting aloud.

speaker MC
dialogue Looks like another day of nothing ahead of us, huh.

speaker N
dialogue You reach down and lightly pet your cat.

speaker MC
dialogue Right buddy?

speaker N
dialogue Your cat meows politely, then leaps off the bed and trots towards an empty food bowl.

speaker MC
dialogue *Sigh* Yeah. Yeah. Here you go.

speaker N
dialogue You fill up half of your cat's bowl, finishing the rest of the food bag.

speaker MC

dialogue The metal walls and floor of the ground floor are nearly spotless, aside for some rust buildup near the windowsill.

dialogue Various prosthetic parts hang along the walls, some hung up on what appears to be a meat rack.

dialogue You flick on the lights, turn on the "open" sign, and sanitize your workstation.

speaker MC 
dialogue Nice. Clean.

speaker N
dialogue You putter around, looking for anything to clean, then settle down in an office chair at the front desk. You power on your computer and check your E-Mail. A few hours pass as you scroll without much as a single customer.

dialogue Shoot away!

dialogue First off... What's your profession?

speaker B
dialogue I'm part of the artsy side of the body mod industry... piercings and tattoos mostly.

dialogue Suddenly, you hear your door slam shut. You jolt your head up in surprise only to see an older looking man standing at the other side of your desk. He's wearing a full blue jumpsuit and leans on a strangely long cane.

speaker MC
dialogue Hello. Can I help you?

speaker W?
dialogue No, you cannot.

speaker MC
dialogue Ok, so why are you h-

speaker W?
dialogue Have you ever thought about what would happen if someone were to find out you were operating without a license, young one?

speaker N
dialogue Your breath leaves your body for a moment as your eyes go wide in shock.

speaker MC
Is that a threat? How do you know that.

speaker W?
dialogue Hahaha! No, no. Just an observation from the janitor next door.

dialogue Janitor next door?

dialogue You're looking at him!

dialogue But there's n-

speaker W
dialogue Name's Washi. That's MISTER Washi to you, kid.

dialogue That's a-

speaker W
dialogue Convenient name for a janitor? You bet it is.

speaker MC
dialogue Actually I was going to say that it's a name I don't recognize. Are you new here?

speaker W
dialogue Been here at least twice the length that you have!

speaker MC
dialogue Why did you come here exactly?

speaker W
dialogue Moved out of my old house in the Undercity, real nasty place that is! Too many rats and mutants.

dialogue No. Why did you come here. To my shop.

dialogue Mr. Washi immediately turns on his heel and walks towards the front door.

speaker W
dialogue Seeya later kiddo!

speaker MC
dialogue Wait, where are you-

speaker N
dialogue The door slams shut as loudly as when he entered. You sit in front of your desk in stunned silence. You're utterly confused and vaguely frightened. How did he know you weren't licensed... And did he say that there were mutants in the Underci-

speaker N
dialogue Your cat loudly meows from the other side of the room. You check your watch and realize that it's already dinner time.

speaker MC
dialogue Alright Hal, I'm coming.

speaker N
dialogue He meows politely in response, then bounds upstairs. You lock up the downstairs area, then head up to your living space.

speaker N
dialogue You hang out with Hal for a while, watching the news and various shows until the power abruptly cuts. 

speaker MC
dialogue Third night in a row. Let's hit the hay, Hal.

speaker N
dialogue Hal meows, then jumps onto your bed when he sees you getting ready.

speaker MC
dialogue Good boy.

speaker N
dialogue You tuck into bed and turn on your old radio alarm. The only thing on your mind is that strange old man. You wonder how he could be a janitor next door if the unit next to you is an abandoned pizza parlor with a collapsed roof.

speaker N
dialogue You elect to ignore those thoughts for now, as the room grows colder and colder by the minute. The sounds of hovercars and speedboats outside are mostly drowned out by the calming hum of heavy downpour. Listening to the ambience of the city, you eventually fall asleep.
