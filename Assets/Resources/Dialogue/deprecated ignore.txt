dialogue Your joints ache as you slam your hand against the old-tech radio on your desk. You stand up from the rock hard bed and stretch wide like cat, grunting aloud.

speaker MC
dialogue Looks like another day of nothing ahead of us, huh.

speaker N
dialogue You reach down and lightly pet your cat on the top of his head.

speaker MC
dialogue Right buddy?

speaker N
dialogue Your cat meows politely, then leaps off the bed and trots towards an empty food bowl.

speaker MC
dialogue *Sigh* Yeah. Yeah. Here you go.

speaker N
dialogue You fill up half of your cat's bowl, finishing the rest of the food bag.

dialogue You flick on the lights, turn on the "open" sign, and sanitize your workstation.

speaker MC 
dialogue Nice. Clean.

speaker N
dialogue You putter around, looking for anything to clean, then settle down in an office chair at the front desk. You power on your computer and check your E-Mail.
