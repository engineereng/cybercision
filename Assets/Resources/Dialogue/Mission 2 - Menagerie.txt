dialogue GOOOOOD MORNING MONSOON LOWS! Today we've got storms-a-plenty! Prepare yourselves for mass torrential downpour, cause it looks like the Downtowners are sending us some rain AND flooding. Can I get a womp womp for the Downtowners to show how much you hate th-

speaker MC 
dialogue Allllright enough of that.

speaker N
dialogue You once again slam your hand against the old radio, turning it off. For a second you worry about breaking it, but then stop when you remember the time you dropped it down a flight of stairs.

speaker MC
dialogue Morning, Halloran.

speaker N
dialogue Hal meows, then stretches out, awaiting your aid.

speaker MC
dialogue Here you go, buddy.

speaker N
dialogue You reach over to a small workdesk on the side of your bedroom, picking up a teeny prosthetic leg. You walk back over to Hal and attach it to the stump on his back leg.

speaker MC
dialogue Better?

speaker N
dialogue Hal responds to your caring words by leaping off the bed and running to his food bowl. You pick up a bag of cat food, only to realize that you ran out.

speaker MC
dialogue Dammit. I forgot to buy more.

speaker N
dialogue You give Hal a scratch on the head, then equip your standard outfit.

speaker MC
dialogue Gonna head to the store to get you some food, buddy.

speaker N
dialogue You walk down the stairs and go to head out the front door. You only take a single step outside before you bump headfirst into someone.

speaker MC
dialogue Whoa! Hello?

speaker B
dialogue Oh! My mistake, sorry 'bout that!

speaker MC
dialogue Miss Aguja. What are you doing here?

speaker B
dialogue Ah! Well I felt like I left in a bit of a hurry yesterday, hah. I wanted to give ya my thanks!

speaker MC
dialogue You're welcome.

speaker B
dialogue The repairs ya did are workin' better than my hand ever has! It's makin' my job a whole lot easier, I tell ya that.

speaker MC 
dialogue That's good to hear. Make sure to keep the joints oiled if you want it to work at full capacity for longer.

speaker B
dialogue Oh! Sure, yeah.

speaker N
dialogue Bobbi scratches her chin. Then pops off her left hand.

speaker B
dialogue I actually liked the work ya did on my hand so much that uh, I want'cha to do my left.

speaker MC
dialogue Oh. I see. The shop isn't technically open right now, but I suppose I can make an exception.

speaker B
dialogue Great! Can ya do it as soon as possible?

speaker N
dialogue You feel like you were supposed to do something, but the prospect of more money outweighs those thoughts.

speaker MC
dialogue Sure. Have a seat, I will get to work.

speaker B
dialogue Thank ya! I also brought this for ya.

speaker N
dialogue Bobbi holds out her hand as well as a box of fresh servos. You pick them up and place them on your desk. The servos look new.

speaker MC
dialogue Thank you, that will compensate for a lot of the cost.

speaker N
dialogue You remember that you were supposed to buy cat food for Hal. Your eyes go wide as an idea sparks.

speaker MC
dialogue Actually, instead of paying, could you just go out to the nearest corner store and pick up a bag of cat food for me? That should cover everything.

speaker N
dialogue You walk over and bring her an empty bag of the food you normally buy.

speaker B
dialogue You got a li'l kitty?

speaker MC 
dialogue Yes. His name is Halloran. Hal for short.

speaker B
dialogue You got a deal! I'll go buy ya another one of these, but I wanna see your li'l guy when I get back here.

speaker MC
dialogue Works for me.

speaker N
dialogue Bobbi gives you a thumbs up, then walks out the door. You turn your attention to the hand and servos on the desk in front of you.

dialogue Just like yesterday, you are suddenly shocked by the sound of the front door slamming shut.

speaker W
dialogue Hello again!

speaker N
dialogue Mr. Washi's sudden appearance startles you. He's dressed in the exact same way as yesterday, even down to the wet mop being used as a cane.

speaker MC
dialogue Ah. Mr. Washi, welcome.

speaker N
dialogue The word "please leave" resounds and repeats through your head.

speaker W
dialogue Hey kiddo! Got an answer for my question from yesterday yet?

speaker MC
dialogue You asked me like three different questions. Which one are you-

speaker W
dialogue Nice hand you got here!

speaker N
dialogue Mr. Washi picks up Bobbi's hand, then shakes it around. He turns it back and forth, then examines the joints.

speaker MC
dialogue That's not yours. Put it down.

speaker W
dialogue The work you've done on it is quite good!

speaker N
dialogue Mr. Washi tosses the hand into the air, then catches it while grinning from ear to ear.

speaker W 
dialogue How much did it cost for this fine hand to be repaired?

speaker MC
dialogue Uh. The owner brought her own servos, so it was almost free.

speaker W
dialogue Really? Well that's interesting.

speaker MC
dialogue How so?

speaker W
dialogue Because I don't believe you!

speaker N
dialogue Mr. Washi grins, then puts Bobbi's hand back on the table with a loud thud.

speaker MC
dialogue Would it kill you to not be so rough with a customer's prosthetic?

speaker N
dialogue Mr. Washi chuckles and raises an eyebrow.

speaker W
dialogue No. But what would you do if I said yes.

speaker MC
dialogue I. What-

speaker W
dialogue About what I expected from a kid like you. So many words to say but nothing to back them up.

speaker N
dialogue A thump resounds from outside, and Mr. Washi turns to look out the window. The front door swings open and Bobbi walks in with a full bag of cat food.

speaker B
dialogue Heya! I'm back with the-

speaker N
dialogue Bobbi stops when she sees Mr. Washi standing at the desk.

speaker B
dialogue Why hiya there! I'm Bobbi. Are you friend of Firth's?

speaker MC
dialogue I have no clue who-

speaker W 
dialogue Yes! My name is Washi, good to meet you young lady.

speker B
dialogue Well it's good to meet you too, Washi.

speaker W
dialogue Firth and I were just having a conversation about the little hand on their desk.

speaker B
dialogue Oh, that's mine!

speaker N
dialogue Bobbi locks eyes with your cold, dead stare.

speaker B
dialogue Is she finished?

speaker MC
dialogue Yes. Just fine.

speaker N
dialogue Bobbi exchanges the cat food for her hand, then slots it onto the stump.

speaker MC
dialogue How does it feel?

speaker B
dialogue As amazin' as the right one. Thanks again!

speaker MC
dialogue You're welcome.

speaker N
dialogue You take the bag of cat food off the table, then bring out Hal's bowl and pour it in.

dialogue An excited meow is heard from upstairs, and Hal comes sprinting down right towards his food. He gobbles it up happily.

speaker MC
dialogue That's Hal. He's my roommate.

speaker B
dialogue OH MA GAWD! Aren't you the cutest li'l thing!

speaker N
dialogue Bobbi pushes past Mr. Washi and begins petting Hal with her newly fixed hands.

speaker MC
dialogue How much was the food?

speaker B
dialogue A helluva lot less than paying for a full hand, I'll tell ya that much. 

speaker W
dialogue Food in exchange for a hand? A worthy enough trade.

speaker B
dialogue You're tellin' me! I feel I darn did rip 'em off with a deal like that.

speaker W
dialogue Hmm. I see.

speaker N
dialogue Hal spins round for a better petting angle and steps into his water bowl. It splashes all over Bobbi's face and the floor around her.

speaker B
dialogue Bleh! Eugh! Gross.

speaker MC
dialogue Here. Use this.

speaker N
dialogue You hand Bobbi a hand towel and then walk over to Hal.

speaker MC
dialogue You're a silly little guy, you know that?

speaker N
dialogue Hal meows, then flops over. His prosthetic leg starts to freak out and flail in different directions.

dialogue You quickly stop the leg from moving, then forcefully detach it. Water drips from the sockets.

speaker MC
dialogue Aw buddy come on, you bugged it up again.

speaker B
dialogue Poor li'l guy...  I didn't notice his leg!

speaker MC
dialogue I saw him crawling around the streets without a leg around... eight months ago. He gave me the whole cat-eyes look and I couldn't say no. Brought him inside and adopted him full stop.

speaker B
dialogue That's real sweet of ya...

speaker W
dialogue I have never seen a leg for cats. Where did you get such a thing?

speaker N
dialogue You hold up Hal's leg for Mr. Washi to see.

speaker MC
dialogue Made and designed it myself.

speaker W
dialogue Really?

speaker N
dialogue Bobbi and Mr. Washi take a look at the leg while you prepare your tools. 

speaker B
dialogue This looks very... uh. Intricate?

speaker MC
dialogue Took a lot of work to get those parts to be as small as they are.

speaker N
dialogue Mr. Washi smiles, looking you in the eye.

speaker W
dialogue You must be a very skilled cybersurgeon, I wonder how someone like you ended up in a place like this-

speaker MC
dialogue None of your concern.

speaker N
dialogue You yank the leg out of Mr. Washi's hands, then place it down on your work desk.

speaker MC
dialogue If you'll excuse me, I'm going to get to work now.

speaker W
dialogue I would like to watch your process. Give you a little critique!

speaker N
dialogue Mr. Washi smiles and looks on attentively, his presence here annoys you, but you stomach it for now. Bobbi goes over and has a seat on her usual chair.

speaker MC
dialogue First I have to debug it, then I have to switch the battery, and then I'll likely have to debug it again.
