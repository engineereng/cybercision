# Cybercision
A puzzle/minigame game with visual novel elements and story. The player will use their logical and finesse skills to perform cybernetic surgery on a grab bag of wacky patients and customers to experience the daily life of Firth in the rain drenched cyberpunk setting of Monsoon City.

This demo includes 3 missions, with branching outcomes depending on your performance in the surgery minigames.
